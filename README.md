# Ansible-Buttler
Create a light weight automation ecosystem using Ansible

#Install CentOS 
a) Not as WSL but I recommend having a VM machine where you can spin-up your CentOS. I have used 8.3.1 version on VMware workstation.
Use link : https://wiki.centos.org/Download , to download appropriate ISO.
b) Simply have a new VM created - my VM has 20GB harddisk , 8GB RAM and 12 core CPUs; and point to your ISO. You can easily find guides in internet if you go wrong at some points.
But its pretty straight forward

#Install Ansible
